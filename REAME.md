## 💡 Why Me?

I’m a builder at heart — someone who loves turning ideas into deployable, maintainable products.

With over **4.5 years of experience** across startups and enterprise environments, I specialize in **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **React**, **Angular**, **Android Studio** , and **cloud platforms** like **AWS**. I’ve shipped full-stack applications, optimized cloud runtimes, fixed security issues, and automated pipelines — all while learning something new every step of the way.
